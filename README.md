vlc-control
===========

Remote control of VLC, from another computer, which can handle DVD navigation
via cursor-keys and Enter, plus a few more things.

The bits missing from the web UI!


Setup
-----

This script is written to Python 3.2 and uses curses.  It expects a UTF-8
locale for some of the characters printed.

It has been tested on MacOS.  OS success/failure reports welcome.

Turn on the "RC" interface (also called "OLDRC") in VLC.
Set an IP address and port to listen on in VLC's preferences.  
<strike>Eg, to listen on port 4321 for any IPv6 address, enter: `[::]:4321`</strike>  
By [code inspection](https://github.com/videolan/vlc/blob/master/modules/control/oldrc.c#L301-L306),
I see that vlc now parses this input as a URL.  So enter: `tcp://:4321/`

Invoke this script with: `vlc-control -s my-vlc-server.hostname.example.org:4321`


Limitations
-----------

No file-selection or browsing UI: I still use the web UI for that.
Patches welcome.

Shift-\<digit\> assumes US keyboard layout.


Problems
--------

I am experimenting with use of gerrithub.io for pull requests and reviews in
this repository:

* <https://review.gerrithub.io/#/q/project:philpennock/vlc-control,n,z>
* Clone, anonymous HTTP: <https://review.gerrithub.io/philpennock/vlc-control>
* SSH Push URL: <ssh://review.gerrithub.io:29418/philpennock/vlc-control>
  (requires account)

I accept pull requests and issue reports via the github interfaces for such.
